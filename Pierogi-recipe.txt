Here's Linda's pierogi recipe:

Knead together the following items to make dough:
4 cups flour
2 eggs
1/2 cup water
2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon sugar

Mix the following items to make the filling:
2 lbs farmers' cheese (you may need 1/4 of this)
2 eggs
1 pinch of salt
2 tablespoons sugar

Roll out the dough 1/4 inch thick
Use a round glass to cut out the dough
Drop the filling inside
Fold the dough in half, wet your fingers and pinch the ends close so it looks 
like a half moon Use a fork to completely close the dough and make a design 
around the edges Drop in boiling salt water until they float to the top or fry 
them up with butter and serve with sugar
